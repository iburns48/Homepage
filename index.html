    <h1>Chapter 1, 2, and 3 Reflection</h1>
    <p>The first three chapters of “The Psychology of a Web Developer” show how language, technology, and identity can affect people’s learning processes. The narrator’s journey shows how media shaped her communication and goals. Spleak started as something to comfort her. After further interactions she learned that it wasn't actually as good as she first thought. This defeat made her think about the authenticity and connection of Spleak. This change inspired the narrator’s curiosity about web development and coding, turning frustration into productive creativity. The chapters reflect a story of a growth mindset, where digital interaction becomes a gateway to self-discovery and ambition for the future.
